<h1>Integrated Assignment/ Quiz Schedule Management System- "UNLOAD-ME" </h1>
<br>
<h3>A very basic web app that provides the instructors and students of an institute with a unified system to manage assignment - related tasks.</h3><br>
<li>This project was motivated by the fact that in most institutes, the instructors have no idea of the extent of work - pressure on students due to other assignments whent they are giving out their own assignments/ declaring quizes</li><br>
<li>Unload-Me gives an easy-to-use, interactive and intuitive interface to both the parties to manage the teaching in healthy way</li><br>
<h4> Features : </h4>
    - Intuitive calendar - based GUI using <i>FullCalendar</i> plugin<br>
    - Instructors can view <i>ALL</i> assignments of all students enrolled in a particular course<br>
    - They select a date and time according to this information and reduce the work load on students<br>
    - They could give their perceived difficulty rating to the assignment - this also gets displayed within paranthesis on the UI for other instructors<br>
    - Only the instructor who gave the assignments is allowed to modify/delete it<br>
    - Students could also give difficulty ratings to the assignment and this gets reflected in the generated stats<br>
    - Generates stats when required - to give feed-back to instructors and also junior students about courses<br><br>
